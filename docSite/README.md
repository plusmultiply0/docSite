# DocSite

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) to keep my notes for front-end and demo.

Below are some common commands.

**developing server**

```
$ npm run start
```

**Build**

```
$ npm run build
```
**test build local**
```
npm run serve
```

**Updating Docusaurus version**
First, add dependencies to your package.json.
Then
```
$ npm install
$ npx docusaurus --version
```
